# ManicMarik's Starfinder House Rules

### Potions, Serums, and drugs
All serums are less effective when taking more than 1 dose per 24 hours.

For each additional dose it subtracts 1 HP for every 2 mk of serum taken within 24 hours.

*(taking a mk2 healing followed by a mk 1 healling give 3mk total for a -1 HP on next dose)*

(note overdosing can add more damage instead of healing it)

>*Thus taking multiple serum of healing mk2*
>- 1st use     3d8 healing
>-   2nd use	  3d8-1 healing
>-   3rd use	  3d8-2 healing
>-   4th use	  3d8-3 healing
>
> *If you take a serum of healing mk1 at this point, you will receive 1d8-4 healing*

Previous use |  decrease on next use
-------------|-----------------------
2mk |-1
3mk |-1
4mk |-2
5mk |-2
6mk |-3

### Kasathas attacks
The Kasathas race gets more attacks, they take -2 per additional attack (first attack 0, 2nd -2, 3rd -4, 4th -6)
	Only one long arm or 2H-melee can be equipped at a time.  All targets must be with a 60 degree arc (attacks of opportunity exclude this limitation)
	If using a heavy weapon no other weapons can be equipped.
		Examples of valid configurations
			Laser rifle (upper arms)
			Pulse caster pistol (Rt lower arm)
			long sword (Lt lower arm)

### Using Unarmed combat for attacks of Opportunity
Any PC with the feat of Improved Unarmed Combat and has a free hand can treat their front and side squares as threatened and make attacks of opportunity even if they are using a one handed small arm.

### Mechanic Drones
Mechanic drones use the PCs initiative and go just after the PC.  They require PC to issue commands (swift action) if they wish to change the drones behavior.
* Level 1 - limited AI.
  * No self directed behavior, poor threat assessment
* Level 7 - expert AI.
  * Behaves like a trained animal, will not override commands
* Level 20  - True AI.
  * Fully sentient, can override commands.  Completely dedicated to PC. 

### Crafting
A Mechanic, Technomancer or a Mystic can craft items using the Engineering and Mysticism skills the max level of the item is the skills ranks.
	If they have a profession skill in specialized crafting the max level is the professions bonus.
	Note: it is possible the maximum level of item to be crafted can be below the PCâ€™s level

Success in crafting requires a DC check.
If using profession roll Engineering or Mysticism at DC10 for a +2 aid.  If another PC wants to aid they must be able to craft that level item as well and adds another +2 aid.

	
Item level	 |	DC check	|	Cost Multiplier
-------------|--------------|------------------
PC Level -10 | DC5  | 0.5x
PC Level -5  | DC10 |0.75x
PC Level     | DC15 | 1.0x
PC Level +1  | DC20 | 1.5x
PC Level +2  | DC25 | 2.0x
PC Level +3  | DC30 | 3.0x
PC Level +4  | DC35 | 4.0x
PC Level +5  | DC40 | 5.0x

 A failed DC check causes the loss of all materials.  A DC fumble, PC can not attempt this craft until next level up of profession. *(You have a fundamental misunderstanding of the process)*

### LOOT, credits and Build Points
Besides getting items and credits for loot, PCs may also get BP (Build Points).  These are the currency to purchase and maintain large and expensive items such as starships or planetary compounds.

A BP is awarded when the item's sale value would be too large for personal use.

Examples are the sale of starships, artifacts.

A starship will sell for 10% it's BP value (so a Tier 5 135 BP starship will return 13.5 BPs)
	Players can not buy BPs, they must be earned.  They can sell them, 1 BP = 1000cr
	or use them to buys starship components (or starships)

	They can also be used to purchase smaller vechicles (including cars and motorbikes). (in this case 1 BP = 100,000 cr)

	BP's smallest increment is 1/10 of a BP.  All transactions will round to the nearest 1/10.

### Starship Options
If the PC's aquire a starship they have a few optons.
1.  Keep it.  Note Starships require yearly maintence,
It keep a ship operational it requires spending 1% of the Ships BP value per year ( or have on staff 1 engineer per 100BP of ship value - round all fractions up)
2.  Sell it for scrape - 10% of it's value in BP as BP.
3.  Upgrade it.
