# ManicMarik's Starfinder House Rules

PCs with Class of **Mechanic, Mystic, or Technomancer** and a **crafting profession** can choose to have starting items in that profession as hand crafted by themselves. (must meet the crafting level requirements)

### Crafting Professions

Profession            |Applies to
 ---------------------|--------------------------------
Weaponsmith |melee, firearm, heavy weapons, and ship/vehicle weapons
Armorsmith |body armour and vehicle/ship frame,skin, armor
Programmer |computer controls and software
Artificer |magic and hybrid
Ship Systems |vehicle/ship engines and controls, excluding frame/armor, ship weapons, and programming
Genesplicer |Biologicals and genetic manipulation 

The Kasathas race gets more attacks, they are naturally quad-dexterous at Dex 15, otherwise take -2 per additional attack (first attack 0, 2nd -2, 3rd -4, 4th -6)
	Only one long arm or 2H-melee can be equipped at a time.  All targets must be with a 60 degree arc (attacks of opportunity exclude this limitation)
	If using a heavy weapon no other weapons can be equipped.
		Examples of valid configurations
			Laser rifle (upper arms)
			Pulse caster pistol (Rt lower arm)
			long sword (Lt lower arm)

All Vesks are ambidextrous.  If a Vesk is using a one handed firearm and someone moves in or out of their space they get an attack of opportunity (ie squares around them are threatened if they have an unengaged hand).

An Android with a Dex of 15+ and the feat of Basic Melee weapon proficiency and has a free hand can treat their front and side squares as threatened and make attacks of opportunity even if they are using a one handed small arm.

### Mechanic Drones
Mechanic drones use the PCs initiative and go just after the PC.  They require PC to issue commands (swift action) if they wish to change the drones behavior.
* Level 1 - limited AI.
  * No self directed behavior, poor threat assessment
* Level 7 - expert AI.
  * Behaves like a trained animal, will not override commands
* Level 20  - True AI.
  * Fully sentient, can override commands.  Completely dedicated to PC. 

### Crafting
A Mechanic or a Mystic can craft items using the Engineering and Mysticism skills the max level of the item is the skills ranks.
	If they have a profession skill in specialized crafting the max level is the professions bonus.
	Note: it is possible the maximum level of item to be crafted can be below the PCâ€™s level

Success in crafting requires a DC check.
If using profession roll Engineering or Mysticism at DC10 for a +2 aid.  If another PC wants to aid they must be able to craft that level item as well and adds another +2 aid.

	
Item level	 |	DC check	|	Cost Multiplier
-------------|--------------|------------------
PC Level -10 | DC5  | 0.5x
PC Level -5  | DC10 |0.75x
PC Level     | DC15 | 1.0x
PC Level +1  | DC20 | 1.5x
PC Level +2  | DC25 | 2.0x
PC Level +3  | DC30 | 3.0x
PC Level +4  | DC35 | 4.0x
PC Level +5  | DC40 | 5.0x

 A failed DC check causes the loss of all materials.  A DC fumble, PC can not attempt this craft until next level up of profession. *(You have a fundamental misunderstanding of the process)*

### Potions, Serums, and drugs
All serums are less effective when taking more than 1 dose per 24 hours.

For each additional dose it subtracts 1 HP for every 2 mk of serum taken within 24 hours.

*(taking a mk2 healing followed by a mk 1 healling give 3mk total for a -1 HP on next dose)*

(note overdosing can add more damage instead of healing it)

>*Thus taking multiple serum of healing mk2*
>- 1st use     3d8 healing
>-   2nd use	  3d8-1 healing
>-   3rd use	  3d8-2 healing
>-   4th use	  3d8-3 healing
>
> *If you take a serum of healing mk1 at this point, you will receive 1d8-4 healing*

Previous use |  decrease on next use
-------------|-----------------------
2mk |-1
3mk |-1
4mk |-2
5mk |-2
6mk |-3
