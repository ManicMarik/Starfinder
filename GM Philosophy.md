# GM Philosophy (Starfinder)

My goal is for everyone to have fun and play a character they like and are invested in to improve.

A general goal is for PC to level up once each (new level / 2)sessions.


### Going off-script
PCs can always abandon a story line and go Ad-hoc.  There may consequences for doing so and it may be difficult to pick the story back up in the future but as a GM the PCs determine their actions. (fate will usually support the PC goals or Karma payback, not be used to railroad a storyline).

When in an Ad-hoc mod the PC may end focusing on XP, loot or Reputation to the detriment of the others.  When in Ad-hoc mode XP tends to be about 1/2 of what PCs would get in a story line as there is no XP for goals completed.  I will usually develop new story hooks and lines within 2 session that the PCs may engage in to get goal based experience.

Actions may have long term consequences.  *Just saying (cough … murderhobos … cough)*

### Experience and Loot
XP is awarded per person for their actions.  Encounter XP is normally shared evenly.
Bonus XP may be given for “cool” or actions befitting your character (particularly if that action wasn’t advantageous) and sometimes just for out of character comment that made me laugh (provided there isn’t so much out of character chatter that it distracts from the game). 

Loot gathered should enable each PC to acquire 1 weapon + 1 armour of new the level.
  (this is modified by acquisition of artifacts or shares/maintenance in a starship.)

### Inventories
Rule of reasonableness for equipment, you generally have small stuff that isn’t listed if it makes sense you would.  Bulk and Encumbrance matter, no infinite crates of ammo/batteries, slinging 2 long arms means neither can be drawn as an action as they tangle up.

*Note:  Some adventure arcs are driven to be resource constrained.  In those cases more detailed inventories are desired.*

### Party Quorum
I will play with who ever shows up.  If it’s just one person they may get a solo adventure out of the canon timeline.

### Use of Tech
I believe in over-leveled equipment as a force equalizer.  There will probably be lots of opportunities to buy or acquire gear of higher level than you are.

Avoiding or mitigating an encounter is still completing it and will be awarded XP (usually a percentage depending on the risks incurred)

I don’t believe in “balanced” player classes.  Fighting classes will deal out a lot of hurt while the tech classes will not, but you really don’t want the fighters disarming traps or be the face in diplomatic situations.
  If we get into a situation where your character is always second string and it’s effecting your enjoyment let me know and we can work towards unique skills or items to help you shine as well.

### Death and Perma-Death
Death happens,  RP can save you from most of them so be sure to keep a reserve.

Perma-deaths are usually from very bad decisions (I’ll attack that dragon, or run across that molten lava) or extremely bad luck - failing all 3 RP saves.  As a GM I will not allow a permadeath from events you had no agency in (ie traps, sneak attack, surprise round in an encounter)

A PC with a perma-deathed character can roll another to join the party.  The new character will be 1/2 less level than the party average and some of the background and equipment will be negotiated with the GM.
