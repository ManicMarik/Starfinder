## On the Server
---
 - Open the Story **Starting Character**.
This will have all the starting information on it as well as links and items to drop into your inventory.

---

## What is going on
Roll a 1st level character using only **Starfinder Core Rule Book** Race, Theme, and Classes.
*Themeless is not allowed.*

Abilities are the standard 10 pts in each stat, race/theme/class modifiers then distribute 10 additional points.
No Stat can start over 18


Roll on the **Homebrew Table - Starting Alignment and Quirk**
*This will roll your alignment and 3 possible quirks.*

Copy the alignment and 1 Quirk to your character sheet.





    For more information on Alignment see (core pg24-25)

```
To allow playablity of conflicting alignments,
players consider the party an extension of themselves.

If an action would be upsetting to another player efforts
should be made to justify it or hide it to avoid
congitive discord.

If there is a disagreement on an action due to alignment
belief then the 2 opposing characters will roll off (1d20
with the higher value choosing the action) (Other players
may assist one side or the other with a +1)
```
### Starting Equipment
The Player Characters have just finished a recruit orientation mission with the Merc Guild **World Walkers** on Legacy Station and are traveling to Absalom Station and the Pact worlds to look for employment.

You start with
* Stationwear, flight suit *(core pg197)*
  * Dark green with Black Trim
  * Merc Team Patch and Name Patch
* Knife, survival *(core pg171)*
* Laser pistol, azimuth *(core pg173)*
* credit stick  with 1000 credits on it.

You can purchase additional supplies using the Core, Armory, Character Operations Manual, Galaxy Exploration Manual and Starship Operations Manual.

You can purchase items of any level, though only your level +5 are readily available at major markets.  Aquiring items beyond that require using player resources and contacts.

### Notes
PCs can use items that are their level +5 with no reduction in skill checks.  Items with higher level may impose penalities. *(For weapons this might be increased chance of fumble or negatives to hit.  For Armor it may be minuses to DEX.  For augmentations it may be experiencing trouble synchronizing.)*

### World Walkers Mercenary Guild
Members of the guild are independent contractors and can either take work independently with no interaction with the guild or take work under the Guilds aegis.

Benefits working under the guilds aegis.
* Guild will post bond and member Life insurance
* Guild resources are available (more personel, research)
* Members earn advancement points to increase their Guild rank
* Guild will take 10% profit from contract and all salvage for jobs worked under their aegis.
