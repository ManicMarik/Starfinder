***Technomancer***

**Additional Magic Hacks**


**Energy Shield** (Ex)
As a standard action, you can use a battery to activate
an energy shield around yourself.  This shield provides
you with a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your
Intelligence modifier plus your technomancer level. The shield drains
1 charge per point it generates from the battery. The shield
remains active for 1 minute per technomancer level or until all of
its temporary Hit Points are depleted, whichever comes first.
Once used, you cannot use this ability again until you spend 1
Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest;
your shield automatically shuts off during this period of rest.

**Imbuing Rune** (Su) 1st Level
You can imbue a weapon with a magic sigil patterned on the rune of
the eldritch knight, allowing the weapon to act as a magic
weapon for the purposes of bypassing DR and affecting
incorporeal creatures. This takes 10 minutes, and you can
imbue only a single weapon at a time. If you imbue a new
weapon with the Imbuing rune, any previously
imbued weapon loses this benefit. When calculating the Hit
Points and hardness of a weapon imbued with the rune, treat its item level as 5 higher.


**Additional Feats**

**Crafting profession**
You add a skill profession with the ranks equal to your level.  Can be taken multiple times.
You use your magical skills to commune with the gaints in the field to gain insight into the profession.
Weaponsmith	melee, firearm and heavy weapons
		Armorsmith		armour and vehicle/ship frame,skin, armor
		Programmer		computer controls and software
		Artificer		magic and hybrid
		Ship Systems	vehicle/ship engines and controls, excluding frame/armor
		Genesplicer     Biologicals and genetic manipulation 

Technomancer crafted items are considered hybrid and normal programming / engineer / mysticism will analyze as it shouldn't work.
programming code looks like a CF, with multiple recursions, GOTOs, and logic breaks
Engineering electrical circuits are open loops but still work.
